# Desktop Runtime Logo

The logo for the Desktop Runtime team. It has some neat features:

 * It's fluid, since we're working with all the
   native desktop programming languages and adapt to change
 * It's animated, since it'll almost always be seen on a screen
 * It's using the system's font it's seen on, since we want to meet
   people on their operating system of choice
